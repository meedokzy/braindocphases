            - I haven't slept for 31 hours.<br>
            - there are several syringes in my body, you see?<br>
            - they're all for sleeping and making me feel relaxed.<br>
            - much more than I should.<br>
            - what if I go to sleep and can't wake up from this nightmare?<br>
            - oh, what happened to my head?<br>
            - nothing. it's just an attempt to switch.<br>
            - do you see the syringe on top of me?<br>
            - it's all that's left of my brain.<br>
            - all the little things that destroy me are inside of that.<br>
            - it's like a virus injecting itself into my parts.<br>
            - please keep experimenting on me until I reach to the end.<br>
