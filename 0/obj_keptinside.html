            - this is my favorite captivity.<br>
            - I just stay here.<br>
            - I stare at the screen for days as my eyes melt.<br>
            - it's addictive, it feels good.<br>
            - but now I'm blind.<br>
            - I don't see reality like I used to. I can't see anything anymore.<br>
            - but I can give up at any time, no matter when.<br>
            - No one will miss me.<br>
