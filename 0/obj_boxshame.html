            - talking to myself is much easier than talking to you.<br>
            - imagining scenarios is much more enjoyable than real life.<br>
            - I love you, but please don't look at what's under this box.<br>
            - there are curses here.<br>
            - I think I feel nothing with the relationship about this.<br>
